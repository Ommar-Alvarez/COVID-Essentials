# COVID Essentials

The purpose of the COVID Essentials application is to provide users with a seamless experience in their search for businesses that continue to offer their services despite quarantine restrictions. It's another means of easing the dissemination of information only providing results for businesses that are still open during times of quarantine. COVID Essentials can be simplified as using a request-response application design that leverages the power of the current Yelp Fusion (v3) API.
